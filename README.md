# ARMath

> An Android mobile app that recognizes the surrounding environment, generates mathematics problems, and supports interative problem solving via physical and touchscreen interaction. This project is currently under development. 

## Key Features
- Visual understanding of the surrounding environment (DeepLearning used)
- Inference of mathematical properties from the visual information
- Automatic generation of math problems
- Tangible user interaction for problem solving
- Physical user interaction for problem solving

## Environment
- The proejct is built with Unity3D 2018.2.10(or above)
- The executable is tested with Android 25 or above devices (e.g., Galaxy Tab S3 and S5e)

## Dependencies
- Tensorflow 1.4 (Unity3D/C# plug-in used)
- [Unity3D ML-Agent](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
- Android SDK v25

## Usage
- Follow the general [Unity3D/Android build instruction](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-android-device-testing)
- Use the latest .scene file for build
